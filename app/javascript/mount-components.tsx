/**
 * mountComponents
 *
 * This code attempts to find all elements that contain a data-react-component
 * attribute, and then to mount components matching that name onto the page in
 * those locations. This code also parses any props contained in a data-props
 * attribute and passes those along to the component too.
 *
 * For example, a page containing:
 *
 *     <div data-react-component='App' data-props="{}"></div>
 *
 * Would have a component called `App` mounted into the location of that div
 * tag. This then allows us to intermix React components with our Rails
 * application, which can be particularly helpful if we have an older Rails app
 * that weâ€™re enhancing with some newer React components.
